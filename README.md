# BTG Pactual Software Engineer Challenge

This project is developed as part of the BTG Pactual Software Engineer Challenge. The application processes orders and generates reports based on them.

## Instructions

- The application is developed using [YOUR TECHNOLOGY STACK HERE, e.g. Java, Spring Boot].
